# SnakeCube

![SnakeCube](/SnakeCube.png)


## The SnakeCube project works towards the direction of automating and containerizing complicated genome assemblying workflows for use in HPC domains.
Developed by the GenomeNerds Lab of IMBBC (HCMR), the de-novo genome assembly pipeline is provided in a single container image form, and can be run in any linux-based environment.

The pipeline is benchmarked and optimized for its safety and performance.
In its directory, you can find the user guide and its info, its source code and all the files related to its testing process.


### Citation and Credits ###
The pipeline was developed and tested by Nelina Angelova et al., with the support of the HPC team of IMBBC, HCMR.
