# The SnakeCube project works towards the direction of automating complicated genome and transcriptome workflows.
## Developed by the GenomeNerds Lab of IMBBC (HCMR), the pipelines are provided in a single file, container image form, and can be run in several environments.
## Today, two such sub-projects exist and are already available for exploitation:

1. The Genome Assembly Pipeline
2. The Transcriptome Assembly Pipeline
