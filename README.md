# SnakeCube

![SnakeCube](/SnakeCube.png)


## The SnakeCube project works towards the direction of automating and containerizing complicated genome and transcriptome workflows for use in HPCs.
Developed by the GenomeNerds Lab of IMBBC (HCMR), the pipelines are provided in a single file, container image form, and can be run in several environments.
For the moment, three such sub-projects exist and are already available for exploitation:

1. The Genome Assembly Pipeline
2. The Transcriptome Assembly Pipeline
3. The ddRAD Analysis Pipeline (automated Stacks)

The Genome Assembly pipeline, is the most benchmarked and optimized pipeline in the time being.
In its directory, you can find the user guide and its info, its source code and all the files related to its testing and optimization process.
